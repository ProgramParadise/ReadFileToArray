# ReadFileToArray
I noticed that there isn't a great example of how to write each line of a .txt file into an array. That's why I wrote this! (it works on all browsers ONLY when web hosted)

This program grabs any text file that you give the address for and converts it into an array (for you to iterate through). This program has been used to create an automatic "Quote of the Month" segment for websites. For an example of what this might look like, head to <a href="https://www.programparadise.dev">my website</a> and scroll to the bottom of the homepage.

Feel free to use/modify my code, however please credit me (if you do so). I spent much longer on this program than it should've taken (and I have a newfound appreciation for javascript and its jankiness).
