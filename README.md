# ReadFileToArray
I noticed that there isn't a great example of how to write each line of a .txt file into an array. That's why I wrote this! (it works on all browsers ONLY when web hosted)
<hr>
This program grabs any text file that you give the address for and converts it into an array (for you to iterate through)
